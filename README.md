# 🍷 Wine Quality Dataset — Central Tendency Analysis

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **Central Tendency Analysis** on the Wine Quality Dataset using Python and Pandas. The objective is to understand the distribution and statistical summary of the dataset by calculating key statistical measures such as:

* Mean
* Median
* Mode

This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship** to build strong foundations in data analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand dataset structure and features
* Apply central tendency concepts on real-world data
* Perform statistical analysis using Python
* Interpret and summarize results
* Build a professional data science project for portfolio
